# Description of the project

For this assignment I aim to create an interactive audio visualiser in which the viewer moves on a planet surface (infinitely generated) with the view of a planet in the distance and vastness of space above.

Interactive elements include:

- Moveable camera – the viewer can move their mouse to rotate the camera above, below, left and right
- Visual settings menu – on the right hand side of the screen the viewer can open a menu in order to turn on and off different visual settings as they see fit
- Song selector – in that same menu the viewer can manually select what song they would like to listen to, as well as choose a random song


Visual settings include:
- Frequency-responding line that changes colours
- Loudness-responding circle that changes colours
- Stars that move towards the camera to give the impression of moving at high speed
